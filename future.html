    <h2>High School</h2>
    <p> I either want to go to Polly or McBride for a future high school. Those schools seem really good and I am very interested in the CJI program in both schools!

    <h2>College</h2>
    <p>My mom told me to always aim for the top so I of course would aim for UCLA for a future college. However if I do not make that college I would want to go LBCC.

    <h2>Career Interests</h2>
    <p> I am 70% sure I am going to be a CSI detective but I also kind of want to be a pilot. I was inspired by a man who flew around the world and he said that he wanted to see the world but not in a public plane and spending thousands and thousands of dollars to travel like that. I really want to see the world as well like him and If I am a pilot I would have that chance.

  <h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
    One of my goals is to always have a 4.0 GPA or at least have one B. Another one is to have two pugs when I grow up,<br> one named mug and the other named doug.
