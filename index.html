    <h2>What did they do as president?</h2>
    <p> Thomas jefferson minimized the power of the national government, along with cutting the military by nearly half. Along with this he also repealed many Federalist laws such as the whiskey tax and the sedition act. Jefferson stopped payment to pirates and he stood his ground with the military. Above all he was responsible for the Louisinia Purchase, which doubled the U.S, making more farm land, therefore more settlers and citizens.
